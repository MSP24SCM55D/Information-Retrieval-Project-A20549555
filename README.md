## ABSTRACT

This project showcases an Information Retrieval System that comprises a web crawler built utilizing Scrapy, an indexer fueled by Scikit-Learn, and an inquiry processor created with Flask. The crawler recovers web substance, the indexer makes an altered list utilizing TF-IDF representation, and the processor oversees free-text questions utilizing cosine similitude scoring. Using WordNet for inquiry development progresses the quality of the look comes about. The innovation exhibits capable recovery of relevant records by using client questions. Future enhancements will center on upgrading execution for gigantic datasets and upgrading mistakes dealing with capabilities. In outline, the consideration sets up a strong premise for building flexible data recovery frameworks that have the potential to be connected in different fields.
